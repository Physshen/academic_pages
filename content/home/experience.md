  - title: Research on time-reversal and rotational symmetry breaking in superconductors
    company: Supervised by Prof. Wei Li
    company_url: ''
    location: Artificial Interface Lab, Fudan University
    date_start: '2020-09-01'
    date_end: '2020-12-20'
    description: |2-
        Responsibilities include:
        
        * Used group theory to analyze the pairing symmetry in our sample and help explain the coexistence of
           ferromagnetism and superconductivity 
        * Proposed a topological origin of the two-fold symmetry in transverse resistance, which provided a new
            explanation of similar results reported in Nature 547, 432â€“435 (2017) 
        * Gained rich experience in combining experiments with theories to better understand interplay between
            magnetism and superconductivity
